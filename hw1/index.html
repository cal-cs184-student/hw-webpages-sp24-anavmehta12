        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this Project, I implemented basic rasterization with anti-aliasing methods such as supersampling. I also
            implemented basic hierarchical transforms including translation, rotation, and scaling. Another main idea of this
            project was texture mapping where we mapped textures onto 2d objects through various techniques such as Barycentric
            coordinates to interpolate the textures of given coordinates. For texture mapping, the project supported two kinds of
            Pixel Sampling Nearest Neighbour and Billinear and three kinds of level sampling 0-th, Nearest, and Billinear
            Interpolation. As for my thoughts on this assignment, I found it certainly cemented the techniques we learned
            in the lecture as I had to spend hours debugging and learning what was going wrong. I understood the differences
            between the frame and sample buffer and why each was important. I learned about the importance of defining the
            unwinding direction of the vertices. I learned to understand the partial derivatives and why they were important in
            calculating the specific mip map level.

        <h2>Task 1 - Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                To render a triangle or polygon on a screen, the process begins by identifying the polygon's bounding
                box. This is achieved by calculating the minimum and maximum values among the vertices' x and y coordinates.
                The minimum values, after being floored, define the starting X and Y position of the bounding box, while the
                maximum values, once ceiled, determine the ending X and Y positions. Following this, the algorithm
                iterates from the bounding box's top left pixel’s center to its bottom right pixel’s center. For the center of
                each subsequent pixel in the bounding box we determine through a point-in-triangle test if the center lies
                within the triangle. If the test is positive, the pixel is rendered. This process is repeated across the entire
                bounding box, ensuring that every potential pixel in the triangle is evaluated.

        <article>
            <p>
                My algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle since
                it essentially checks each within the bounding box of the triangle. Therefore, it cannot be any worse by
                design.

        <h2>Task 2 - Antialiasing by Supersampling </h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                For my supersampling algorithm, I dynamically increased the sample buffer size in response to increases
                in the sample rate to accommodate for the subsamples. The modified rasterize triangle function now
                populates the sample buffer with sub samples, coloring them if it passes the point in triangle test. I stored the
                subsamples linearly for efficient and easier access during restoration to the frame buffer. As I
                restored the sample buffer to the frame buffer I aggregated the RGB values across all subsamples for each pixel.
                Supersampling smoothes out the jaggedness of the triangles by minimizing the rapid color shifts from the
                background to the edges of the triangle creating a more balanced color representation.

            <p>
                When our sample rate is 1px we can see that the tip of the triangle is disconnected while as we increase
                the sample rate from 1 -> 16 the edge becomes more and more continuous. This is caused because when we only
                have one subsample we just check whether that pixel is in the triangle leaving us to a very
                unbalanced image but as we increase the number of subsamples and start averaging out the colors we
                increase the probability that these pixels will lie in the triangle allowing for a more smooth image.

                angle, aiming to give the robot a splits-like appearance.

        <h2>Task 4 - Barycentric Coordinates</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                Barycentric coordinates are coordinates used to interpolate different attributes such as textures,
                coordinates, colors by weighting the distance from a given point to the vertices of the triangle where a
                point closer to vertex A is biased heavily more on A's values then B or C.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Illustration of color interpolation in a triangle using barycentric coordinates.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                I created this SVG image to illustrate how Red, Green, Blue blend using barycentric coordinates
                emphasizing the influence of proximity to the triangle vertices on the resulting color. The method assigns greater
                weight to the vertex nearest to the given point, making the point’s color more influenced by that vertex
                color. As a result, points near the vertex associated with Red, for example, exhibit a color closer to
                Red. And at the midpoint between the Red and Blue vertices, we observe a purplish hue, signifying a blend of
                the two colors. The midpoint between Green and Blue reveals a tealish shade, and the midpoint between Green and
                Red presents a brownish color. These colors align with the expected results of mixing the given colors, showcasing
                how barycentric coordinates can interpolate colors.

        <h2>Task 5 - Pixel Sampling for Texture Mapping</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                Pixel sampling involves determining the color and intensity of pixels to display to the screen from a
                given source material.
            </p>
            <h3>Nearest Neighbor Sampling</h3>
            <p>
                Nearest neighbor sampling takes the nearest texture sample colors to the (u, v)
                coordinate. I achieved this by converting screen (x, y) coordinates to their corresponding texture coordinates
                (u,v) through Barycentric coordinates, scaling by the mipmaps dimensions, and then fetching the texel color
                at the scaled coordinates.
            </p>
            <h3>Bilinear Sampling</h3>
            <p>
                Bilinear sampling on the other hand interpolates between the nearest four texel
                samples to achieve a more refined texture color by factoring in the distances to each of the texel
                samples. For this method, after scaling the Barycentric coordinates (p) the four closest texel samples are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Top Left (u01):</strong> Flooring both u and v.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Right (u11):</strong> Ceiling u and flooring v.</li>
                <li><strong>Bottom Left (u00):</strong> Flooring u and ceiling v.</li>
                <li><strong>Bottom Right (u10):</strong> Ceiling both u and v.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The relative positions of p within this bounding box, denoted as s and t, are then calculated. Horizontal
                interpolation between u00 and u10 using s as the weighting gives u0, while interpolation between u01 and u11 gives
                u1. The final texture color is determined by vertically interpolating between u0 and u1 using t as the
                weighting.

            <p>
                Sampling at a rate of <b>1px</b> demonstrates the superiority of Bilinear filtering over Nearest neighbor
                sampling. This is evident as Bilinear filtering more effectively incorporates surrounding pixels, which is
                highlighted by its ability to accurately identify Latitude lines—a task at which Nearest sampling fails. As the
                sampling rate increases to <b>16px</b>, differences between the two methods become less noticeable from afar.
                However, when we take a look using the pixel inspector it reveals that Bilinear filtering still maintains a more
                balanced pixel distribution. This proves that at lower sampling rates, it is more obvious to view the
                advantages of Bilinear over Nearest filtering.

        <h2>Level 6 - "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
        <p>
            Level sampling involves sampling from mipmaps from corresponding mipmaps based on how much on the texture
            coordinates change based off a small increment in screen space coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Magnification:</strong> When there is a steep change in texture coordinates relative to screen
            space coordinates, it indicates that the screen is magnified. This calls for higher mipmap levels to
            provide more detail.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Minification:</strong> Conversely, shallower gradients suggest that the screen is minified,
            requiring lower mipmap levels thus less detail to represent without noticeable loss in quality
        </p>
        <p>
            For <strong>nearest level sampling</strong>, it is necessary to calculate the Barycentric coordinates
            corresponding to <code>(x + increment, y)</code> and <code>(x, y + increment)</code>, where the increment
            is determined by the sampling rate. The next step involves calculating the difference between these
            Barycentric coordinates and the original <code>(u, v)</code> coordinate to find the partial derivatives.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Mipmap level is calculated by taking the logarithm of the maximum of two expressions:
            <code>sqrt(pow(dudx.x, 2) + pow(dudx.y, 2))</code> and <code>sqrt(pow(dvdy.x, 2) + pow(dvdy.y, 2))</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For <strong>linear level sampling</strong>, the process involves flooring and
            ceiling the calculated Mipmap level to determine the adjacent stored Mipmap levels. The colors from the
            floored and ceiling Mipmap levels are then linearly interpolated to derive the resulting color.

            Our most aliased result arises when setting the default sampling technique at level 0 with nearest pixel sampling.
            This approach yields blocky and discontinous edges, leading to a distinctly pixelated image. In contrast, when we
            switch to billinear sampling it creates smoother transition between edges and colors. And moreso exemplified
            when we billinearly sample and level sample, we see an even cleaner and smoother edge definition. As for just level
            sampling we see that the edges are continous but do not transition well between colors. Evidently, the combo of
            billinear pixel sampling and nearest level sampling emerges as the superior technique.
