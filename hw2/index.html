		<h2>Project Overview</h2>
		<p>
			In this Project, I implemented 1D de Casteljau Subdivision where we used control points and linear interpolated them
			to form points that lie on a Bezier Curve. I then extended de Casteljau algorithm to evaluate Bezier Surfaces. I
			implemented Phong Shading through area weighted vertex normals. Another major portion of this project was Loop
			Subdivision which implemented through two key operatios, Edge Flipping and Edge Splitting. Edge flipping requires
			flipping a shared edge while edge splitting splits a triangle into four new seperate triangles with a midpoint vertex.
			Loop Subdivision then uses both to implement 4-1 subdivision by splitting edges then flipping edges that connect new
			and old vertices. We also update old vertex positions by weighting it's old position based on it's degree and the sum
			of its neighboring vertices. As for my thoughts on this assignment, I found it certainly cemented the techniques we
			learned in lecture as I had to spend hours debugging and re-reading the slides to figure out what to implement and
			what was going wrong. This project gave me a great understanding of the half edge data structure and an intuition on
			how bezier curves are formed through control points

			<h3>de Casteljau Algorithm</h3>
			<p>
				de Casteljau's Algorithm is an algorithm that operates through a recursive process of linear interpolation between
				points, gradually reducing the number of points until a single point is returned, one that must lie on the bezier
				curve. We do this for all positions on the curve t ranging from t=0 at the beginning of the curve to t=1 at the
				end of it.
			</p>

			<h3>Implementation</h3>
			<p>
				I implemented de Casteljau's by looping over the given set of points, where at any step could be a set
				of intermediate points or the original control points, linear interpolating between consecutive pairs of points
				with the weight t. I add all these new found points to a vector and recursively call the function with these
				points. Once the vector contains one point, I return the point then return the intermediate points.

		<h2>Part 2 - Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau </h2>
		<article>
			<h3>How de Casteljau's Algorithm extends to Bezier Surfaces</h3>
			<p>
				de Casteljau's Algorithm extends to Bezier Surfaces by evaluating n sets of control points where each set of
				control points represents a bezier curve in the u direction. Once interpolating all curves in the u direction we
				can then use the points on the u curves to interpolate points that lie on bezier curve in the v direction. We
				repeat for various values of u, v to reconstruct the Bezier surface.
			</p>

			<h3>Implementation of de Casteljau</h3>
			<p>
				To implement de Casteljau for Bezier Surfaces, I implemented three different functions. A recursive function,
				evaluateStep that computes a step of the de Casteljau algorithm and returns either a set of intermediate points
				or a point on the Bezier curve. A wrapper function, evaluate1D, that calls evaluateStep with a set of control
				points and a interpolation parameter t designed to abstract away the recursive steps to just return a point on the
				Bezier Curve. And finally a function that iterates over all sets of control points and calling evaluateStep on a
				set and adding the returned point to a vector that contains all points on a Bezier curve in the u direction. I
				then call evaluate1D on that u vector as control points to find a point on the Bezier surface.

		<h2>Part 3 - Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h2>
		<article>
			<h3>Implementation</h3>
			<p>
				Starting at the given vertex, I pointed to it's halfedge and obtained the normal of halfedge's face and the length
				of every side of that face. Found the area of the triangle and added the weighting of each face's normal to it's
				area to a rolling vector sum. I moved the halfedge pointer to it's twin to find the next face and iterated until
				the halfedge pointed back to the start halfedge. Then we just return the normalized vector sum.

		<h2>Task 4 - Edge Flip</h2>
		<article>

			<div>
				<h3>Implementation of Edge Flip Operation</h3>
				<p>
					To implement the Edge Flip operation, I decided to first store the half edges forming f0 (Left Face) and then
					use the twins of those half edges to find the half edges of f1 (Right Face). I identified each vertex forming
					the two triangles (V0, V1, V3) and (V0, V2, V3) then changed the half edges that each vertex stores.For the
					original vertices adjacent to the shared edge (V1, V2), their half-edge references were updated to one of
					its other departing half-edge. Regarding the new vertices adjacent to the edge post-flip (V0, V3), their
					half-edge references were set to the edge intended for flipping and its twin, respectively. Next, f0's
					half-edge was set to one of the top three half-edges, and f1's half-edges to one of the bottom three. Each
					face was then restructured by linking certain pre-existing half-edges from the two faces, creating a cohesive
					face. Finally, we set the neighbors of each flipped halfedge.

			<h3>Debugging Process</h3>
			<p>
				One of the most signifigant challenges I encountered was a bug stemming from forgetting to reconnect the
				half-edges for newly created faces, which resulted in openings in the mesh when I flip an edge. The debugging
				process was mainly gaining understanding of all the pointers involved and the halfedge data structure. I
				debugged by drawing both triangle's pointers before and after the flip to properly plan out the operation.

		<h2>Task 5 - Edge Split</h2>
		<div>
			<h3>Implementation of the Edge Split Operation</h3>
			<p>
				For the edge splitting, we have to add two new faces <code>(f2, f3)</code>, two new edges <code>(e2, e3)</code>,
				eight new half edges (<code>f0h0, f0h1, f1h0, f1h1, f2h0, f2h1, f3h0, f3h1</code> and
				<code>f0h2, f1h2, f2h2, f3h2</code> are the original halfedges)</code> and finally the
				midpoint vertex (v4). For each face and original vertex, we can update their halfedge pointer to their
				corresponding original halfedges, ie <code>f0,V0->f0h2</code>. The association between each face and its original
				vertex with their respective original half-edges is maintained, for example, f0 and V0 are linked to
				<code>f0h2</code> The position of V4 is determined by averaging the positions of vertices V1 and V2, which are
				connected by the shared edge. V4 is then assigned to one of the new half-edges leaving V4. The half-edge pointer
				for each edge is updated to one of the two half-edges that lie along it. Finally, each face is reconstructed by
				settings the neighbors of the new half edges.

			<h3>Debugging Process</h3>
			<p>
				The debugging process was very straightforward as Task 4 already prepared me for potential bugs and understanding
				of how to solve them.

		<h2>Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h2>

		<h3>Implementation of Loop Subdivision</h3>
		<section>
			To implement Loop Subdivision, I split the routine into four different loops.

			<h4>Loop 1</h4>
			This first loop iterates over the edges, calculating the vertices positions after splitting. For existing vertices,
			their new positions are calculated using the formula <code>(1 - n * u) * original_position + u *
			original_neighbor_position_sum</code> where <code>(1 - n * u) * original_position</code>. The formula balances between
			maintaining the vertex's original location with the influence of the adjacent vertices' positions. The position of the
			midpoint vertex created by the split is then defined by <code>(V0 + V1) * 3/8 + 1/8 * (V2 + V3)</code> and this
			calculated positions is then stored in the current edge's newPosition.
			</p>

			<h4>Loop 2</h4>
			<p>
				We traverse the edges of the original mesh, splitting each edge e. The vertex v, returned by splitEdge, represents
				the newly added vertex by the edge split. We then assign v's position to the newPosition that was calculated and
				stored for edge e in the previous loop. We must set the vertex and both new edges' isNew to true indicating they
				are mesh elements that were created by subdivision.
			</p>

			<h4>Loop 3</h4>
			<p>
				Following the edge splitting, we then loop over the splitted mesh flipping any newly created edges that connect an
				old vertex to a new vertex.
			</p>

			<h4>Loop 4</h4>
			<p>
				Finally, for every pre-existing vertex in the mesh we update it's position to the newPosition calculated in loop
				1.
			</p>

			<h4>Debugging Tricks</h4>
			<p>
				One very important debugging trick I implemented was for loop 2. As we had to iterate over the original mesh
				edges, I had to copy the mesh edge elements into a seperate list as split the mesh while iterating over caused an
				infinite loop.
			</p>

			<h3>Observations on Subdivision</h3>
			<p>
				For each level of subdivision, we can noticeably see the decrease in sharpness of edges of this icosahedron as the
				vertices are being pulled in by its neighboring vertices smoothening out the vertex.
			</p>
			<div class="images">

				</figure>

				<figure>

					<figcaption>Mesh after two levels of subdivision</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>

			<h4>Improve Corner Sharpness</h4>
			<p>
				To combat this smoothening we can apply lots of uniform edge splits that can reduce the amount that a
				neighboring vertex will move and will pull in the corner vertex less keeping it sharp. Also the newly created
				vertex from the edge split will help preserve the corner vertex even more.
			</p>
		</section>
		<h4>Reducing Asymetry</h4>
		<p>
			As we subdivide the cube, we notice that the cube is becomes more and more asymetric after repeated subdivisions. This
			is because vertices have different degrees which will cause triangles to appear more in certain areas instead of being
			symmetric. We can fix this by splitting the edge across each face to make a more uniform distribution of
			degrees. Comparing both the original mesh and the preprocessed mesh, it is very clear that the preprocessed mesh is
			more symmetrical and the degree of the vertices are more uniform.
